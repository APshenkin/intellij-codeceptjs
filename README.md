# IntelliJ Codeceptjs integration plugin
Integrates <b>Codecept.io</b> under the common Intellij test framework.

## Credits
Big thanks for [Mikhail Bolotov](https://github.com/mbolotov) for reference implementation from [Cypress](https://github.com/mbolotov/intellij-cypress/)

## Compatibility
As the plugin depends on *JavaLanguage* and *NodeJS* plugins, so it requires a commercial version of IDEA (Ultimate, WebStorm etc) 
## Install
Plugin can be installed from the Jetbrains Marketplace. Open '*Settings/Preferences* -> *Plugins*' menu item and type '**Codeceptjs**' in the search bar. See [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html) for details. Please note that base and Pro versions are not expected to run together so you should disable or uninstall one of them to use the other. 
## Usage

### Test run configurations
Plugin introduces a dedicated Codeceptjs [run configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) type
You can create a run config from either file view (directory, spec file) or directly from the code

file view | code view

### Running tests
Just start your configuration. You can watch test status live on the corresponding tab:   
![](./media/run.png)

You can navigate from a test entry in the test tab to the source code of this test just by clicking on it.<br>

### File Structure
Your tests now are displayed in IDEA File Structure tab, where you can quick navigate and use fuzzy search

### TODO:
1. Implement `Data()` block handling

## Build plugin from the sources
```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
````
## Run
Either start IDE bundled with plugin via gradle:
```bash
./gradlew runIde
```                                             
Or install built plugin manually in the Settings->Plugin section of IDEA
